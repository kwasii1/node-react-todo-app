After creating the react frontend:
Create a folder backend in the project root
run npm init
install express and other necessary packages
Create app.js/server.js/index.js file in backend root
require the necessary packages
create auth,controllers,config,routes,models folder


DATABASE SECTION:
run knex init
edit development setting with your database connection information
Create db.js file in config folder
require knexfile.js and knex in the file
create models in the models folder. Require db.js in the models
Use knex migrate:make to create migrations

CSRF SECTION:
Create a csrf_protection.js file in auth folder
Must include a generatetoken and verifytoken function
Require csrf_protection.js in app.js/server.js/index.js
And use app.generatetoken as a middleware
On pages that include forms include an input field with the value set to {csrfToken}
Make sure you configure cors and session middleware correctly!!! This is very important
To get the csrfToken on the frontend use the useEffect hook.
Within it make a get request to the backend which will return the csrfToken in json


AUTH SECTION:
Require passport in app.js/server.js/index.js
Add the passport.initialize and passport.session middleware
Create a local strategy called passport.js that contains login logic. Require passport local in this file
Require the passport.js created in auth in your app.js/server.js/index.js as well
